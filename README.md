# Causal-Modeling
This repository contains the pdf notes covering various topics of causal inference and all the (Python) notebooks for clarification and exemplification of the notes. The notebooks can be accessed directly via de pdf (but the pdf should be downloaded). In general there are two pdf files: one Layman's presentation with a very intuitive entrance to causal inference where most mathematical formulas are omitted and one more technical approach to causal inference with intuitive explanations and examples.
