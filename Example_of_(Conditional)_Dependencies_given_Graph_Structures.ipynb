        "This Notebook aims to show in what graph structures variables are dependent, independent or conditional independent. We create data according to a certain graph structure that contains a v-structure, chain and fork. Using correlation matrix, we show what variables are unconditionally dependent and then for each of these structure we show what happens when we apply conditional independence tests. Finally, we use independence algorithm (GLASSO) to extract the skeleton of the graph. Then we use a causal discovery algorithm (GES) to extract the Markov equivalence graph."
